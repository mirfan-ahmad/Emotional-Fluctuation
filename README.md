# Predicting Emotional Fluctuations

This project focuses on predicting emotional fluctuations based on various factors using machine learning models. The notebook provides a step-by-step guide to preprocessing the data, training the model, and predicting emotional states.

## Overview

The notebook is organized into several key sections:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**:
   - The dataset is loaded and explored to understand the features and target variables.
   - Initial visualizations and summaries of the data are provided for a clearer understanding of patterns.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Missing values are handled, and irrelevant features are removed.
   - Label encoding is applied to categorical variables to make them suitable for machine learning models.
   - The dataset is split into training and testing sets.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Correlations between different features are explored to reduce multicollinearity.
   - Data transformations are applied where necessary to ensure better model performance.

4. **Model Training**:
   - **LightGBM Model**: A LightGBM model is trained on the dataset with fine-tuned hyperparameters to predict emotional fluctuations.
   - Model evaluation is performed using metrics such as accuracy and F1-score.

5. **Predictions**:
   - The model is used to make predictions on the test dataset.
   - Final results are displayed, including the predicted probabilities for different emotional states.
